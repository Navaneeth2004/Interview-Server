    "question_1": {
      "question": "What is React?",
      "expected_answer": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.",
    },
    "question_2": {
      "question": "What are the main features of React?",
      "expected_answer": "The main features of React include Virtual DOM, JSX, component-based architecture, one-way data binding, and state management.",
    },
    "question_3": {
      "question": "What is JSX?",
      "expected_answer": "JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript files.",
    },
    "question_4": {
      "question": "What is the Virtual DOM?",
      "expected_answer": "The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM that React uses to optimize rendering performance by only updating changed parts of the DOM.",
    },
    "question_5": {
      "question": "What is the difference between functional and class components?",
      "expected_answer": "Functional components are stateless, simple JavaScript functions that return JSX. Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and can manage state and lifecycle methods.",
    },
    "question_6": {
      "question": "What are React hooks?",
      "expected_answer": "React hooks are functions that allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features without needing class components. Examples include useState and useEffect.",
    },
    "question_7": {
      "question": "What is useState?",
      "expected_answer": "useState is a React hook that allows adding state to functional components.",
    },
    "question_8": {
      "question": "What is useEffect?",
      "expected_answer": "useEffect is a React hook used to handle side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.",
    },
    "question_9": {
      "question": "What is the difference between props and state?",
      "expected_answer": "Props are immutable data passed from parent to child components, while state is mutable data managed within a component.",
    },
    "question_10": {
      "question": "What is React Router?",
      "expected_answer": "React Router is a library for handling navigation in React applications, enabling dynamic routing.",
    },
    "question_11": {
      "question": "What is context API?",
      "expected_answer": "The Context API is a React feature that allows state sharing across components without prop drilling.",
    },
    "question_12": {
      "question": "What is prop drilling?",
      "expected_answer": "Prop drilling is the process of passing props through multiple components unnecessarily, which can make code harder to maintain.",
    },
    "question_13": {
      "question": "What is Redux?",
      "expected_answer": "Redux is a state management library that helps manage global application state using actions, reducers, and stores.",
    },
    "question_14": {
      "question": "What is the difference between Redux and Context API?",
      "expected_answer": "Redux provides a structured state management system with middleware support, while Context API is simpler and best suited for lightweight state sharing.",
    },
    "question_15": {
      "question": "What is a higher-order component (HOC)?",
      "expected_answer": "A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns an enhanced component with additional functionality.",
    },
    "question_16": {
      "question": "What are controlled and uncontrolled components?",
      "expected_answer": "Controlled components have form inputs managed by React state, while uncontrolled components use direct DOM manipulation.",
    },
    "question_17": {
      "question": "What is reconciliation in React?",
      "expected_answer": "Reconciliation is the process React uses to update the DOM efficiently by comparing the Virtual DOM with the previous version.",
    },
    "question_18": {
      "question": "What is React Fiber?",
      "expected_answer": "React Fiber is a new reconciliation algorithm introduced in React 16 to improve rendering performance and allow incremental updates.",
    },
    "question_19": {
      "question": "What is the purpose of keys in React lists?",
      "expected_answer": "Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed, improving list rendering performance.",
    },
    "question_20": {
      "question": "What is lazy loading in React?",
      "expected_answer": "Lazy loading is a technique that delays loading components until they are needed to improve application performance.",
    }
  };
